# calculator
A simple calculator I made few years ago that supports order of operations, functions, and variables. I've never gotten around to cleaning it up so the code is pretty messy.

Supported operators and functions:
 - a + b
 - a - b
 - a * b
 - a / b
 - a % b
 - a ^ b
 - pow(a,b)
 - cos(a)
 - sin(a)
 - tan(a)
 - acos(a)
 - asin(a)
 - atan(a)
 - sqrt(a)
 - sqr(a)
 - log10(a)
 - log(a)
 - ln(a)
 - floor(a)
 - ceil(a)
 - abs(a)
